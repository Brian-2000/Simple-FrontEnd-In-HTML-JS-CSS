                <h1>DroneSeed's Six-Rotor Heavy-Duty Drones Aim to Offer Fast, 
                    Affordable Wildfire Reforestation</h1>
                
                <h3>Using custom-built heavy-lift uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs),
                    DroneSeed seeds trees from the air wherever they're needed</h3>
                
                <p>Drones are seeing increasing use in industry for everything from site surveys to last-mile delivery services,
                    but DroneSeed is putting its custom craft to work on a different problem:
                    rapidly re-seeding forests after a wildfire, while providing businesses with a way to offset their carbon emissions</p>
                
                <p>"DroneSeed was founded in 2016 with a mission of making reforestation scalable to mitigate the worst effects of climate change,"
                    Cassie Meigs, senior director of client solutions at DroneSeed, tells us. "No off-the-shelf aircraft or deployers would work, 
                    so engineers worked for several years to develop a custom-designed, heavy-lift drone platform, software, charging system, and deployers. 
                    The first prototype of the seed enablement technology using biomimicry was utilized in 2019. The next two years were spent refining the product and scaling operational capacity."</p>

                <h1>OFilm to Deploy Uhnder 4D Digital Radar in 2023 to Advance Automotive Safety in China</h1>
                <p>Uhnder, a leader in digital imaging radar technology for the automotive industry, announced that OFilm Group, a leading provider of intelligent driving solutions, has selected Uhnder’s 
                    Digital Code Modulation (DCM) technology to achieve best-in-class advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to advance automotive safety in China. OFilm will launch a digital radar that
                     delivers superior perception compared to today’s analog radar, especially at night or when visibility is impaired due to rain, fog, dust or sun glare</p>

                <p>“Uhnder’s digital imaging radar is the most powerful solution for resolving the limitations of legacy radar sensors,” said Longbing Zhang, vice president of advanced technology, OFilm Automotive.
                     “Today’s radar sensors are analog-based and suffer performance restrictions, such as low resolution and interference between adjacent radars. OFilm can use Uhnder’s
                      technology to solve these problems and create systems that will improve automotive safety for everyone.”</p>

                <h1>Unique Features Increase Test Efficiency and Flexibility of Rohde & Schwarz ATS1500C</h1>
                <p>The R&S ATS1500C antenna test system from Rohde & Schwarz offers a new temperature test 
                    option and a new feed antenna. These additional features enable temperature-controlled 
                    measurements in a wide temperature range as well as parallel access to both polarizations, 
                    increasing test efficiency and flexibility. The solution will be shown 
                    at EuMW from September 27 to 29, 2022 at booth D18 of the Milano Convention Centre</p>

                <p>The movable R&S®ATS1500C is a compact antenna test range (CATR) based antenna test chamber.
                     It is carefully designed to eliminate ghost targets within the chamber during target simulation 
                     tests and includes a highly accurate positioner for angular measurements</p>

                <h1>Renesas to Acquire Steradian to Expand Its Reach in the Radar Market</h1>

                <p>Renesas Electronics Corporation announced that it has entered into
                     a definitive agreement to acquire Steradian Semiconductors Private Limited, 
                     a fabless semiconductor company based in Bengaluru, India, that provides
                      4D imaging radar solutions, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition is 
                      expected to close by the end of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions. 
                      The acquisition of Steradian's radar technology will enable Renesas to extend its reach
                       in the radar market and boost its automotive and industrial sensing solution offerings</p>

                <p>With the advancements of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in the automotive market, 
                    automotive sensor fusion demand is growing to allow precise and accurate object detection of vehicles’ 
                    surroundings by combining data from multiple sensors, such as cameras, radar and light detection and 
                    ranging (LiDAR). Radar in particular accurately detects objects over long distances, day or night, 
                    even during harsh weather or other adverse environmental conditions. For these reasons, radar is
                     considered an essential sensing technology for ADAS, and the number of radar sensors installed
                      in vehicles is expected to triple over the next five years according to Strategy Analytics.
                       To respond to such growth potential, Renesas is expanding its automotive product portfolio 
                       with Steradian’s radar technology.</p>
